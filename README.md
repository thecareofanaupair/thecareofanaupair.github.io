# The Care of an Au Pair
In 2022-2023, we, a group of four students (Annika, Benjam√≠n, Holly, and Lila) underwent research looking into the system of au pairing in the Netherlands, and the lives of au pairs during their stay. During this time, we learnt a lot and saw ways in which we thought au pairs' lives could be improved, especially in times of crisis. 

We found that au pairs and hosts could benefit from independent resources about au pairing that didn't come from people with investment in the au pairing industry: **we are not after your money here, and we do not benefit by you becoming invovled in the au pair industry**.

We have put together this website in response to what we learnt and heard, in order to help prospective au pairs/host families who are thinking of getting au pairs, and au pairs who may be in need. 

*If you are an au pair, a host parent, or know someone who may be interested in becoming an au pair, it could be worth keeping this website handy just in case.*
